# Changelog

## 0.11.0

- Renamed `isA<T>` to `cast<T>` for better readability.
- Added `"// ignore_for_file: type=lint"` to `custom.headerLines` as default import line.
- Added settings support to custom types serialization. Ex: `Color((x as num).toInt())`.
- Added support to safe nested collections serialization. Ex: `List<Map<String, dynamic>>`.
- Refactor and minor improvements.

Obs: Further nesting won't be supported. For those, use e.g: `List<List>` instead of `List<List<List<int>>>`.

## 0.10.0

- Added `strict_numbers`. "If true, `int` and `double` will use `cast<int>(...)` instead of `cast<num>(...).toInt()` sintax."
- Fix `Generate from Json` missing `class` keyword.

## 0.9.0

- Removed internal default directives.
- Add custom type directives to `fromMap` and `toMap` directly in settings.

Example:

```json
"dart-data-class-generator.custom.types": [
  {
    "type": "DateTime",
    "fromMap": "DateTime.parse(String)",
    "toMap": "toIso8601String()"
  },
  //...others,
]
```

> It follows the same rules as of comment-directives.

```dart
final DateTime createdAt; // DatTime.parse(String), toIso8601String()`
```

> The generator will prioritize the comment-directive first and then the custom type directives defined in settings.

## 0.8.1

- Make sealed and final class compatible. Sealed will behave as abstract and final will behave as concrete.
- Use `Map.from` instead of `as Map<String, dynamic>` for correctly parsing `Map<dynamic, dynamic>` types.

## 0.8.0

New features:

- New setting: custom.headerLines. Adds header lines that shows on top of the generated file.
- New settings: constructor.immutable. Adds @immutable annotation on the generated class.
- New behavior: Add `const` keyword on constructor if the class has no constructor and all properties are final or if contructor.immutable is set to true.

Refactor to better reflect EffectiveDart style:

- Changed fromMap.cast: `T cast<T>(String k) => map[k] is T ? map[k] as T : throw ...`.
- Added `as Map<String, dynamic>` to fromJson.decode.

## 0.7.3

- Added custom.argumentError config in settings. Customize isA() error. Defaults to: "throw ArgumentError.value(map[k], k, '$T ‚Üê ${map[k].runtimeType}');"
- Fix minor bugs.

## 0.7.2

- Added option to ignore serialization with `//ignore`
- Fixed serialization of custom list types.

## 0.7.1

- Improved the regular expression used for parsing directives to correctly handle nested parentheses and brackets.
- Fixed comment-directive conflicts with `//enum`.
- Fixed nested json serialization types comming with unnecessary "?" in mapping.

## 0.7.0

Introducing Custom Serialization:
You can now implement your own custom from/to methods for serialization using comment-directives. Refer to the README for details.

## 0.6.0

Added ArgumentError Safety:

- `isA<T>()` was added to TypeSafe arguments.
- Default Values won't be called on required arguments anymore, unless set on settings.
- Solved dynamic casts and getters called on dynamic.

- Now you can mark enums with a comment-directive. Ex: `final MyEnum type; // enum`.
- Fixed unnecessary null check marks on custom classes.
- Added support to Timestamp and improved DateTime, Color and IconData.
- Refactor and minor improvements.

## 0.5.7

- Updated the badges in README.md.

Generate toString() when converting with Equatable
Other improvements

## 0.5.0

Added support for enums

Class fields can now also be declared after the constructor.
Minor improvements.
